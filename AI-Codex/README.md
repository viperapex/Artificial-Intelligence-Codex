# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

A comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms organized by category.

## Structure

- **1_Supervised_Learning**: Algorithms that learn from labeled data
- **2_Unsupervised_Learning**: Algorithms that find patterns in unlabeled data
- **3_Semi-Supervised_Learning**: Algorithms that use both labeled and unlabeled data
- **4_Reinforcement_Learning**: Algorithms that learn through interaction and rewards
- **5_Deep_Learning**: Neural networks with multiple layers
- **6_Ensemble_Methods**: Combining multiple models
- **7_Specialized_Categories**: Other specialized ML approaches

## Usage

Each markdown file contains sections for:
- Overview and key concepts
- Algorithm details
- Applications and use cases
- Advantages and limitations
- Python implementation examples
